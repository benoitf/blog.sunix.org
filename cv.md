## Summary

### Java
I have 10 years of experience as a Java developer. In addition, I have worked for software vendors such as Nuxeo, Thales in Paris, and Economic Outlook in Australia.

### FOSS
I am fortunate to have had an opportunity to work with Nuxeo, an open source software vendor. For its many advantages, I am very inclined to continue working with and promoting the use of Free and Open Source Softwares.
I am currently an Eclipse commiter for the Eclipse Che project.

### Eclipse CHE
I've been involved in the development of the Codenvy Cloud IDE platform including Eclipse CHE extensions.

### Eclipse RCP
While working at Nuxeo and Economic Outlook over 6 years, I gained valuable experience while working on and contributing to projects with Eclipse RCP.

### Nuxeo
As a Nuxeo core developer and trainer, I position myself as a "Nuxeo expert".

###Agile developer
I am fond of TDD and BDD and believe that even documentations should be the result of test.
In addition, I also have experience as a SCRUM master at Nuxeo.

###Training
As one of the main trainers at Nuxeo, I have a great opportunity to share my knowledge with other people, especially my team mates, which is a responsibility that I enjoy having.
